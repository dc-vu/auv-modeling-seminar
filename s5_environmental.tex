	The environmental disturbances include
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Wind forces and moments
		\item Wave forces and moments
	\end{itemize}
	
	In this context, if the autonomous underwater vehicles are considered to be working at the deep water level, the wind and wave disturbances are not significant enoughÂ to be considered.
	
	\vspace{1cm}
	The wind and wave disturbances become more significant when we consider a surface vehicle, and it could be introduced in the future version.
